Microsoft-Exe-and-Dll-decoder
=============================

EXE Header Decoder and DLLimport decode and Resource Reader.

------------------------------------------------------------
IMPORTANT.
------------------------------------------------------------

If I decide to continue working on this project.
I am going to do a lot of clean up.
I also have to redesign the MZ header reader because it only supports 32 bit at the moment.

------------------------------------------------------------
The Microcode Disassembler is in the works.
------------------------------------------------------------

I thought it was cool to write it in JavaScript. I will be changing it to java at the end.

I could see this as being an fun online tool. I plan on building a java branch.
