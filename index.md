# Help, and documentation.

JFH-Disassembly allows you to decompile software.

Allowing you to create source code, of binary files no matter what operating system you are on, or CPU.

JFH-Disassembly also visualizes binary data, and file types. Showing you what every binary digit read, and it's use.

This tool is also a hex editor, and data forensics tool, for binary files that is fun, visual, easy to use, and understand.

You can also read disk drives sector by sector (one binary digit at a time from start, to end).

# Running the application.

To run the application you need to open the file <strong>JFHApp.jar</strong>. It does not install to the system.

You will also need Java 8, or later installed (latest version is preferred).

You can also download the project. Clone the entire project if you wish to make changes, or have a copy of the source code.

# The Microcode Disassembler.

It was cool to write it in JavaScript. The project can be found <a href="https://github.com/Recoskie/X86-64-CPU-Binary-Code-Disassembler-JS">Here</a>.

The disassembler is rebuilt in Java, for this project.

I plan on creating a ARM core disassembler as well, for mobile devices.

# The new Virtual address mapper.

The improved address mapper can be found <a href="https://github.com/Recoskie/RandomAccessFileV">here</a>.

Without it you do not have a nice virtually mapped binary application in it's proper address space.

Also without it. You would not be able to accurately make changes to sections of a program, or read it.
