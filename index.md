## What is J-Disassembly.

J-Disassembly is designed to be user friendly. For both professional, and absolute beginners.

This tool makes binary files, and formats visual, and also easy to understand, and modify.

Is designed, for anyone new learning how binary files are read, or professional use.

The tools are explained in help, and documentation.

J-Disassembly can visually take binary software apart to create source code. No matter what operating system you are on, or CPU.

J-Disassembly also visualizes binary data, and file types. Showing you what every binary digit read, is used for.

This tool is also a hex editor, and data forensics tool, for binary files that is fun, visual, easy to use, and understand.

You can also read disk drives sector by sector (one binary digit at a time from start, to end).

# Supported formats.

This application currently supports Microsoft binaries formats: .exe, .dll, .sys, .drv, .ocx.

This project is meant to support many different binary file formats, and application formats.

However, only supports Microsoft binary format at the moment. If you wish to contribute a Format. Then put it under the format folder.

# Running the application.

Download as zip. The file <strong>JD-asm.jar</strong> is the application.

You will need Java 8, or later installed (latest version is preferred).

# The Microcode Disassembler.

It was cool to write it in JavaScript. The project can be found <a href="https://github.com/Recoskie/X86-64-CPU-Binary-Code-Disassembler-JS">Here</a>.

The disassembler is rebuilt in Java, for this project.

I plan on creating a ARM core disassembler as well, for mobile devices.

# The new Virtual address mapper.

The improved address mapper can be found <a href="https://github.com/Recoskie/RandomAccessFileV">here</a>.

Without it you do not have a nice virtually mapped binary application in it's proper address space.

Also without it. You would not be able to accurately make changes to sections of a program, or read it.

# Virtual memory view, and hex editor.

A fast custom UI hex editor component: <a href="https://github.com/Recoskie/VHex">here</a>.

# Additional planed tools.

[ ] Boot sector decompilation.

[ ] File system array structure reader (NTFS, FAT32, EXT)
